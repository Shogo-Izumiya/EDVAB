## 活動概要
New words:
.json... JSON (.json) is a text-based data format used in web development for server-client data exchange. It uses key/value pairs and arrays, is easy to read/write, works well with JavaScript, and is common in APIs, configs, and data storage.

- Although I did not do anything specific today, it was a day that gave me many clues. To my surprise, I was able to receive private instruction from Mr. Nakazawa. After the Golden Week holidays, I decided on my research plan and future course of action, which I shared with Dr. Nakazawa. After that, Dr. Nakazawa shared with me the information necessary for this research. I also borrowed a book, so I have to work harder.
- On May 13, some brainstorm about creating AI agent have done by using ChatGPT during prompt engineering class. Some codes were created by prompting. Some new words, system, and function came up that interest me.
