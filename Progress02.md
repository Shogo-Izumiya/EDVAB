## 活動概要
New words:
tapping(hitting) an API... The act of using an API (Application Programming Interface) to send a specific request to an API and retrieve data in response.

- I did some further searching on my own, based on information I got from a senior who created AIzawa Minori on 4/17. As a result, I found that he was using llama Index, a framework that supports application development using LLM, but the name that often appears on the Internet is something else called LangChain, and I found an article with a kind of tutorial on it, so I gave it a try.
- However, I did not actually achieve any results. Perhaps because the code is out of date, errors are occurring when it is run. I guess I need to do another research.
- On April 24th, Mr. Imai made me realize that the information I was referring to was too old. It might not have happened if someone had not pointed it out to me. I am very grateful to Mr. Imai.
- He then told me how to prevent this mistake. In short, how to use search engines correctly. Use the filter called uBlacklist.
And he helped me up to 90% of what I was doing with the site I found yesterday. The remaining 10% may be negotiable here with Dr. Nakazawa, as there is a fee to use OpenAI's model. However, I don't think I am at the stage where I need to spend money to try it yet. I would like to try it out after I have more or less perfected it. I won't bother with setup coding.
